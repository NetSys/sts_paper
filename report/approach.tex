Key insights. We argue that invariants are the right way to think about this
problem. Delta over Anteater: need to detect dynamic configuration bugs.
OpenFlow networks are typically quite dynamic compared to traditional static
(campus) networks. Also need cross-layer debugger (correspondance checks) to isolate where the bug is,
and verify that the network is doing what the application tells it to.
