In the previous section we described common error conditions observed in
software-defined networks. In this section we present techniques for
addressing 
analyze the causes of such
errors, and present techniques for addressing isolating and

Key insights. We argue that invariants are the right way to think about this
problem. Delta over Anteater: need to detect dynamic configuration bugs.
OpenFlow networks are typically quite dynamic compared to traditional static
(campus) networks. Also need cross-layer debugger (correspondance checks) to isolate where the bug is,
and verify that the network is doing what the application tells it to.



We note that some error conditions may not manifest themselves in the same way
as a normal network. Network partitions for example. Most OpenFlow networks
don't keep default routes -- the FIBs are sparse. By checking the FIBs alone,
you won't find .
