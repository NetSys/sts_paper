Three forms of evaluation:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Does our system capture the bugs described by Nicira?
\item Did our system find bugs in third-party applications?
\item Is the overhead of our system reasonable? For now, just a graph that
shows how long it takes to run Anteater in the fuzzer loop. Graphs look
pretty.
\end{enumerate}
