We plan to continue developing \projectname{} with the eventual aim of
publication; we are submitting to SIGCOMM 2012. 

Our plans for future work include the following:

{\bf Detailed Bug Report Analysis.} Pending CTO permission, we've recently
 been granted access to raw bug reports from Nicira users running Onix in production. 
 We'd like to use this data to answer questions about commonly encountered SDN bugs: 
 Of the bug classifications developed in S\ref{sec:bugs}, which are the most common?    
 When administrators trace down the root cause of the bugs, where in the SDN stack are
 bugs most prevalent?

{\bf Build and Evaluate Correspondence Checker.} Our existing implementation does not
include the cross-layer correspondence checker described in \S\ref{sec:architecture}.

{\bf Design, Build, and Evaluate Consistency Debugger.} We built a distributed controller for
POX, but have yet to design and build a consistency debugger to detect and resolve bugs
resulting from replication.~\footnote{We're interested in combining this with techniques to make
programming consistency better by treating the whole network as a distributed system, \eg{} adding
vector clocks to switches and deploying updates as transactions.}

{\bf Improved input generator.} Our current implementation of the input generator is
a naive `fuzzer.' The fuzzer randomly explores the state space of possible flows, but
we believe that more sophisticated techniques (\eg{} high-fideity tracing, symbolic execution) can help
us target input flows to more efficiently explore the space of possible bug-generating inputs. 

{\bf Run on a real, rather than simulated network.} Our evaluation ran on a real POX implementation,
but the physical network controlled by POX was only simulated. True emulation
is necessary to capture important concurrency properties in software-defined
networks.

{\bf Distinguish between transient and persistent errors.} Errors can be either
transient or persistent. Both are important. But very the root causes of these
classes of errors differ significantly. Can we
automatically distinguish the two? That is, can we infer whether a bug is
triggered by a certain order of events in the system, versus a systematic bug
with the NOS state machine?

{\bf Reactive trobleshooting techniques.} \projectname{} passively monitors state of the 
components of the SDN, but it could benefit from reactive techniques like issuing traceroutes
when a bug is first detected; this supplemental information can aid in the debugging process.

{\bf Better tools for administrators.} We plan to develop two techniques to help administrators use
the debugger. First, we plan to allow them to specify their own, custom invariants (deployment-specific policies)
 included with the standard invariants (\eg{} loops, dead ends).
Second, we would like to explore the feasibility of an entirely interactive
debugging process, which would allow administrators to monitor
packets traversing the network step-by-step and inspect FIB entries and network state at each hop.
