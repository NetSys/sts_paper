\abstract{
{\it
    Software-defined networking (SDN) simplifies network management
    by presenting a global, abstract model of network state to 
    management applications, hiding the low-level details of 
    individual switch configurations. \andi{More important than abstract: logically centralized model, 
    \ldots isolating the control logic from the distribution of control-plane state in the network\ldots}
    However, by providing administrators with virtualized abstractions, debugging
    system errors becomes considerably more difficult, as bugs may be 
    present in the control application, the virtualization in the network operating system, 
    the physical switch implementations, or the mappings between any of these layers. \andi{Distance to the metal: Difficult to correlated failure
    occurrence and responsible fault through multiple layers of abstraction}.
    In this paper, we present CLINT, a multilayer debugger for software defined
    networks. CLINT takes advantage of clean interfaces between layers of the SDN stack by interposing between each layer to check for 
    violations of expected invariants from each component of the network controller.
    Using bug reports from production SDN deployments, we demonstrate that
    CLINT can detect and isolate many real problems that encumber networks today.

\justine{Am I right that CLINT doesn't yet handle the inter-controller stuff? I know you wrote a basic replicated controller, but not sure if you have any checks yet. Anyway, if so, we should mention that too...}
\colin{It would be really cool to run the inter-controller stuff by Monday,
mostly just because it makes the problem space way more interesting. We
should be able to just run your application on top of the replicated
controller and call it good.  Of course, we'll see
what happens between now and then.}

\section{Nicira Bug Reports}

Teemu is a bamf. Let's hope his bug reports come in by Monday.

\section{Approach}

Key insights. We argue that invariants are the right way to think about this
problem. Delta over Anteater: need to detect dynamic configuration bugs.
OpenFlow networks are typically quite dynamic compared to traditional static
(campus) networks. Also need cross-layer debugger (correspondance checks) to isolate where the bug is,
and verify that

\section{Architecture}

Details that aren't ultimately that important.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fuzzer
\item Invariant Checks
\item Correspondance Checks
\end{enumerate}

\section{Evaluation}

Three forms of evaluation:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Does our system capture the bugs described by Nicira?
\item Did our system find bugs in third-party applications?
\item Is the overhead of our system reasonable? For now, just a graph that
shows how long it takes to run Anteater in the fuzzer loop. Graphs look
pretty.
\end{enumerate}
