\abstract{

\colin{I think `distributed debugging of consistency and virtualization
errors` is a much more compelling pitch than `cross-layer invariant
checking`. Of course, we haven't got that far yet...}

{\it
    Software-defined networking (SDN) simplifies network management
    by isolating control logic from the distribution of control-plane state in the
    physical network. By abstracting away the details of network
    configuration however, debugging errors in a software-defined network is
    considerably difficult. Besides the control logic itself, bugs
    may manifest themselves in virtualization logic, distribution logic,
    network devices, or the mappings between any of these layers
    in the SDN platform. This increased `distance to the metal` makes it
    difficult for network operators to
    isolate the cause of errors to any particular layer of abstraction. In this paper
    we present CLINT, a cross-layer debugger for software-defined
    networks. CLINT interposes on the layers of the SDN stack to enable
    isolated invariant checking of individual components. Using bug reports from a production SDN deployment, we demonstrate that
    CLINT can detect and isolate many real problems in large-scale networks today.

\justine{Am I right that CLINT doesn't yet handle the inter-controller stuff? I know you wrote a basic replicated controller, but not sure if you have any checks yet.}
\colin{It would be really cool to run the inter-controller stuff by Monday,
mostly because it makes the problem space way more interesting. We
should be able to just run your application on top of the replicated
controller and call it good.  Of course, two days is not a large amount of
time in any case...}
