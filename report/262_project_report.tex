\abstract{
{\it
    Software-defined networking (SDN) simplifies network management
    by presenting a global, abstract model of network state to 
    management applications, hiding the low-level details of 
    individual switch configurations.
    However, by providing administrators with virtualized abstractions, debugging
    system errors becomes considerably more difficult, as bugs may be 
    present in the control application, the virtualization in the network operating system, 
    the physical switch implementations, or the mappings between any of these layers.
    In this paper, we present CLINT, a multilayer debugger for software defined
    networks. 
    CLINT interposes between layers of the SDN stack to check for violations of expected
    invariants from each component of the network controller, detecting subtle, cross-layer bugs 
    and pinpointing the component responsible for causing the error. 
    Using bug reports from production SDN deployments, we demonstrate that
    CLINT can detect and isolate many real problems that encumber networks today.

\justine{Am I right that CLINT doesn't yet handle the inter-controller stuff? I know you wrote a basic replicated controller, but not sure if you have any checks yet. Anyway, if so, we should mention that too...}

\section{Nicira Bug Reports}

Teemu is a bamf.

\section{Approach}

Key insights.

\section{Implementation}

Details that aren't ultimately that important.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fuzzer
\item Invariant Checks
\item Correspondance Checks
\end{enumerate}

\section{Evaluation}

Two forms of evalution:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Does our system capture the bugs described by Nicira?
\item Did our system find bugs in third-party applications?
\end{enumerate}
