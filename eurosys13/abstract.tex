Software bugs abound in distributed systems, and debugging
often involves painstaking manual inspection of log files.
In this paper we present a system to selectively prune extraneous
inputs from logs. We find that na\"ive pruning
results in incomprehensible divergence from the original execution; we show
that a small amount of domain knowledge allows us to recognize whether events in
a pruned execution are semantically equivalent to events in the original
execution. We also find that fully-determinisitic replay is not possible
when modifying the event history; our system demonstrates that a relaxed
replay model is still capable of
aiding troubleshooting for a large range of difficult bugs.

We apply our technique to several software-defined networking control
platforms---Floodlight, POX, and NOX---and
are able to isolate the minimum causal sequence of inputs that triggered
two bugs: faulty failover logic between replicated controllers, and incorrect
synchronization with the physical network.
