Software bugs abound in the development of distributed systems, and debugging
often involves painstaking manual inspection of log files of subtantial
length. In this paper we answer the question: is it possible to
selectively forget extraneous inputs from a system log? Na\"ive pruning
results in incomprehensible divergence from the original execution; we find
that a small amount of domain knowledge allows us to recognize whether events in
a pruned execution are semantically equivalent to events in the original
execution. Modifying the event history means that fully-deterministic replay is
not possible; we find that a relaxed replay model is still capable of
aiding troubleshoting for a large range of difficult bugs.

We apply our technique to several software-defined networking control
platforms---Floodlight, POX, and NOX---and
were able to isolate the minimum causal sequence of inputs that triggered
two bugs: faulty failover logic between replicated controllers, and incorrect
synchronization with the physical network.
