Software-defined networking (SDN) is a structured approach to
building network control planes, providing a general-purpose
platform on which control logic can be deployed. The SDN
platform shields higher-level control logic from the
complexities of state distribution and the details of
physical forwarding. The platform may additionally provide a
virtualized view of the underlying network state to enable
highly concise specifications of intended behavior. While the SDN platform
makes writing control logic easier, it also 
complicates the task of troubleshooting errors;
it is painstaking to isolate the root cause of errors when there are multiple
levels of indirection between the high-level control logic and the low-level
switch configurations. We propose to facilitate troubleshooting in SDN networks by
checking for {\em correspondence} between abstraction
layers. We demonstrate that such a system, called \projectname{}, is able to help locate
virtualization and consistency problems that may arise in SDN deployments.
