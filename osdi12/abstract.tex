The predominant technique for troubleshooting distributed systems,
log analysis, is tedious and error-prone. In this paper we leverage the
structure of software-defined networks to
improve on the status quo of troubleshooting tools for networked systems.
We present two techniques for localizing the root cause of network policy
violations: cross-layer correspondence checking detects inconsistencies between lower-level
network configuration and higher-level policies dictated by control
applications, thereby localizing the system component where policy-violations first
appear; and \simulator{} localizes the minimal causal set of network events
leading up to the policy-violation, thereby differentiating harmless
policy-violations from pernicious policy-violations. In evaluating our tools on
three controller platforms -- Frenetic, Floodlight, and POX -- we find N bugs,
including isolation breaches,
faulty failover logic, and consistency problems between replicated
controllers.
