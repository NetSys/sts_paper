In this paper we leverage the
structure of the SDN software stack to automate the process of troubleshooting
networks. We present two techniques for programmatically localizing the root cause of network problems:
cross-layer correspondence checking infers what problems exist in the network, 
and where in the control software the problem first developed; and
\simulator{} infers when the triggering event(s) occurred. We evaluated
our tools on
three controller platforms---Frenetic, Floodlight, and POX---and found several bugs,
including isolation breaches,
faulty failover logic, and consistency problems between replicated
controllers.
