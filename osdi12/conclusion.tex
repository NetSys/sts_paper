\begin{itemize}
\item Distributed systems are fundamentally hard to build correctly 
\item $\rightarrow$ troubleshooting tools important
\item Teemuâ€™s insight: SDN is far from being stable. Also, SDN is mostly implemented
networking people, who are now involuntarily learning about the fun of
distributed programming for the first time, simply because the software
architecture wasn't there before SDN.
\item We described techniques to localize two dimensions of root causes:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Correspondence-checking localizes component of system where root cause
    manifests. 
    \item Simulator localizes time aspect -> yields minimal causal set
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Our paper seeks to improve the process of troubleshooting errors in the SDN
platform. We focus on large, production networks, 
where controllers are distributed across multiple servers
and the platform provides a virtualization abstraction to one or more tenants.
We present two mechanisms, cross-layer correspondence checking
and \simulator{}, designed to help troubleshooters automatically identify
and isolate inconsistencies between high-level policy and low-level
configuration. Our intent throughout this work is to convince
the troubleshooting community to think outside of the NOX!
