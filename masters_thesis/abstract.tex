Software bugs are inevitable in software-defined networking (SDN) control planes,
and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time-consuming task.
In this paper we discuss how to improve
control software troubleshooting by presenting a technique, \simulator,
for automatically identifying
a minimal sequence of inputs responsible for triggering a given bug.
%\Simulator~works by
%iteratively pruning inputs from the history of the execution, and
%coping with divergent histories by reasoning about the functional equivalence
%of events.

We apply \simulator~to four open source SDN control
platforms---Floodlight, ONOS, POX, and NOX---and
illustrate how our technique found minimal causal sequences for
the bugs we encountered.
