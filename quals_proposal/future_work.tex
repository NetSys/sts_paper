Unfortunately, treating the software as a blackbox disallows us from
providing any guarantees on the minimality of the MCSes we produce.
In this section we flesh out plans for research on
(i) providing provable guarantees on minimality, (ii) developing optimizations
to make the provable scheduling techniques practical, and (iii) showing
that our techniques can be applied to general distributed systems in a
practical manner.
