Before closing, we present a timeline for completion of the proposed research:

\begin{itemize}
\item Complete: [SIGCOMM 2014] Presented work on identifying minimal sequences without making assumptions about the
language or instrumentation of the software under test~\cite{sts2014}.
\item Planned: [SOSP 2015] Work on (i) providing provable guarantees on minimality, (ii) developing optimizations
to make the provable scheduling techniques practical, and (iii) showing
that our techniques can be applied to general distributed systems in a
practical manner.
\item Graduation: Spring 2016.
\end{itemize}
