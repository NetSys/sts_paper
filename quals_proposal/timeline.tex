Before closing, we present a timeline for completion of the proposed research:

\begin{itemize}
\item Complete: [SIGCOMM 2014] Presented work on identifying minimal sequences without making assumptions about the
language or instrumentation of the software under test~\cite{sts2014}.
\item Planned: [SOSP 2015] Work on (i) finding an infeasible but provably correct
approach, and (ii) finding practical approximations to this approach, many of which will
involve leveraging empirical properties of (iii) different classes of distributed software
systems (beyond just SDN control software).
\item Graduation: Spring 2016.
\end{itemize}
