Before closing, we present a timeline for completion of the above research:

\begin{itemize}
\item Complete: [SIGCOMM 2014] Presented work on identifying minimal sequences without making assumptions about the
language or instrumentation of the software under test.
\item Planned: [SOSP 2015] Work on (i) providing provable guarentees on minimality, and (ii) showing
that our techniques can be applied to general distributed systems in a
practical manner.
\item Graduation: Sprint 2016.
\end{itemize}
