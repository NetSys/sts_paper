Software bugs are inevitable in distributed systems,
and troubleshooting is a tedious, time-consuming task.
In this dissertation proposal we argue that it is possible to
automatically identify minimal sequences of inputs
responsible for triggering
test case failures, thereby easing the troubleshooting process.
We begin by describing work that has already been completed on
identifying minimal sequences without making assumptions about the
language or instrumentation of the software under test.
We then outline proposed research on providing provable guarentees on
the minimality of the event sequences.
