Software bugs are pervasive in distributed systems,
and troubleshooting is a tedious, time-consuming task.
In this dissertation proposal we argue that it is possible to
automatically identify minimal sequences of inputs
responsible for triggering
test case failures, thereby easing the troubleshooting process.
We begin by describing work that has already been completed on
identifying minimal sequences without making assumptions about the
language or instrumentation of the software under test. This work was applied
to one type of distributed system: software-defined networking (SDN) control
software. We end by outlining plans to broaden the application of our techniques
beyond SDN and provide a stronger theoretical foundation for the mechanics
of the techniques.
