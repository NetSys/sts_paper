We demonstrate the effectiveness of \simulator{} by reproducing our example Floodlight
bug, and documenting the effectiveness of the pruned output.

We were able to reproduce the problem show in Figure~\ref{fig:example} in our deterministic runtime environment. The
emulated switches in our simulator support the \emph{role} vendor extension to
connect to several controllers. The inter-controller synchronization and heartbeat
protocol is proxied through the simulator for control over the timing. After the
master controller dies, a new switch is associated with the slave controllers, and
integrated into the system with an unmerged flow-table, resulting in a persistent
policy-violation between the flow-table representation in the controller and the switch.

\colin{Waiting on experiment to finish before describing pruning details, time
       taken, how many explored, number of trials,
       parallelism, etc.}
