We were able to reproduce the problem shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example} in our
deterministic runtime environment\footnote{The code is publicly available}, and apply \simulator{} succesfully.
We ran two Floodlight controller instances, modified with a port for
extracting the views, in their own processes (not in
VMs), and connected them to two simulated switches. We did not add causal
annotations or interpose on internal events of the controller, but instead used a
heuristic to wait for $.5$ seconds between injecting inputs to allow the
controllers to fully react. We injected 4 extraneous link and switch failures, along with the
the race condition controller crash and switch connect event.
The algorithm succesfully pruned all extraneous
inputs, despite non-determinism in the Floodlight internal events. With 6
inputs total, the algorithm took 3 minutes to run. With full determinism and
interposition, we expect that the algorithm should work well for less
fabricated cases.
