We were able to reproduce the problem shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example} in our
deterministic runtime environment\footnote{The code is publicly available},
and apply \simulator{} successfully.
We modified the Floodlight software to provide an interface for extracting its
physical view. We did not add causal
annotations or interpose on internal events of the controller, but instead used a
heuristic to wait for $.5$ seconds between injecting inputs to allow the
controllers to fully react. We ran two of the modified Floodlight controller
instances, connected to two simulated switches, and injected 200 extraneous link
and switch failures, with the controller crash and switch connect event\footnote{We used a switch connect
event rather than a link failure event for logistical reasons, but both
can trigger the race condition} that triggered the blackhole interleaved among them.
On ten repeated runs, the algorithm successfully pruned all extraneous
inputs despite non-determinism in the Floodlight internal events. With full determinism and
interposition, we expect that the algorithm should work well for less
fabricated cases.
