We demonstrate the \simulator{} workflow by reproducing a bug in the Floodlight
SDN control platform and documenting the effectiveness of the pruned output.
In this section we detail the Floodlight case study.

Floodlight is the open source control platform built by BigSwitch
networks~\cite{bigswitch}. Floodlight is distributed across multiple
controllers, and provides support for virtualization.
Consider the following case described in the
Floodlight~\cite{floodlight} source code\footnote{Note this issue was
independently discovered by the developers of Floodlight.}: for high availability, Floodlight can run as a
distributed controller, with switches connecting to several replica controllers at the
same time. In this setup, one controller assumes the role of \emph{master} and
thereby gains the authority to issue state changing requests to the switches.
The other controllers are in \emph{slave} mode and thus do not perform any
state-changes on the switch. Here, a race condition can occur when a switch
connects to the controllers shortly after the master controller has died, but
before a new master has been selected. In this case, all controllers will be in
the slave role and thus will not take responsibility for clearing the switch
flow table. At some point, one of the controllers is elevated to to
\emph{master} role and will proceed to manage the newly connected switch, based
on an inconsistent flow table.

Using \projectname, we were able to reproduce the problem. The
emulated switches in the simulator support the \emph{role} vendor extension to
connect to several controllers. The inter-controller synchronization and heartbeat
protocol is proxied through the simulator for control over the timing. After the
master controller dies, a new switch is associated with the slave controllers, and
integrated into the system with an unmerged flow-table, resulting in a persistent
policy-violation between the flow-table representation in the controller and the switch.
