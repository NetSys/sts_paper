Modern software-defined networking control platforms are highly complex distributed
systems. When control software behaves incorrectly, it is difficult
for developers to identify the exact events that caused the system to enter
an erroneous state. In this paper we address the problem of automatically
identifying fault-inducing input from execution logs. We evaluate our
algorithm and system on three popular SDN platforms---Frenetic, Floodlight and POX---and
found or reproduced three bugs:
isolation breaches and faulty failover logic between replicated controllers.
