Software bugs are inevitable in distributed systems,
and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time-consuming task. In this paper we show how to improve
troubleshooting by presenting a technique
for automatically identifying
a minimal sequence of inputs responsible for triggering a given bug, without
making assumptions about the language or instrumentation of the
software.
We apply our technique to SDN control software, including five open source SDN control
platforms---Floodlight, NOX, POX, Pyretic, ONOS---and
illustrate how the minimal causal sequences our system found aided the
troubleshooting process.
