Software bugs are inevitable in distributed systems,
and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time-consuming task. In this paper we focus on software defined
networking control software, and show how to improve
the troubleshooting process by presenting a technique
for automatically identifying
a minimal sequence of inputs responsible for triggering a given bug, without
making assumptions about the language or instrumentation of the
software. We apply our technique to five open source SDN control
platforms---Floodlight, NOX, POX, Pyretic, ONOS---and
illustrate how the minimal causal sequences our system found aided the
task of finding root causes for bugs.
