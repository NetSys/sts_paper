Problem statement:
- Need to be clear that we don't have all internal events.
- If we don't have all internal events, can't simply minimize entire trace.
- System isn't deterministic, in the sense that the timings of the inputs
  matter. The system is concurrent, but that's not the crucial point -- if it
  were serializable then timings wouldn't matter. If it has timers, it's not
  deterministic.
  Or, call it "timing matters", i.e. not serializable
  This is distinct from determinism, in the sense that non-determinism just means
  that with even with exact same timings and inputs, the result may differ.
- In the problem statement, need to point out that our goal is (or is not) to
  be able to find equivalent invariant violation states. This is for both
  greybox and DPOR.


Differentiating ourselves from thread schedule minimization:
- In describing how thread schedule minimization works, very important to
  point out that we need an "oracle" that will tell us whether the subsequence
  is well-formed or not (i.e. indeterminate)
- Delta debugging + DPOR is novel!
- Three differences between us and thread schedule minimization works:
  - Different optimization metric. They care about length of execution, we
    care about number of inputs.
  - DPOR will find alternate states that exhibit the same violation
    signature. thread schedule minimization never goes off-path, i.e. it only
    finds *Exactly* the original end-state.
  - Runtime of thread schedule min. << DPOR


Random insights:
- A scheduler for distributed processes (including interposing on the network) is really equivalent to a schedule
  on a single machine. The order messages are delivered (i.e. asynchrony) is
  encoded in the thread schedule.
- Practically speaking, mention that two (equivalent) states may exhibit the same bug. That's fine:
  just run it twice.
- IDEA: systematically/algorithmically explore levels of interposition. Start
  with blackbox, if that doesn't work, try with network interposition, etc.
  all the way up to DPOR.


Need to be added to the SIGCOMM paper:
  - Does it work with blackbox?
  - (already basically included:) how much non-determinsim there was, i.e.
    what we needed to set max_replays_per_subsequence to.
  - Point out that we can crank out more synthetic bugs at the drop of a hat.
    Perhaps also point out why we didn't have more previously reported bugs
    (b/c SDN is too immature!)
