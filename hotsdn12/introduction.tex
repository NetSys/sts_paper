\begin{itemize}
\item SDN abstractions hide details (on purpose!). They don't decrease
complexity though!
\item $\rightarrow$ SDN platform is complex (distributed system! replicated controllers,
virtualization, multiple-tenants, failures, churn...)
\item $\rightarrow$ platform bugs are common
\item Troubleshooting requires access to details
\item $\rightarrow$ troubleshooting in SDN (without a debugger) is hard.
\colin{</ why it's hard>}
\item Status quo is to painstakingly look at logs. Some work on NOX (NICE), static
analysis of dataplane (Anteater, HSA) but nothing for the general
(Nicira-scale) SDN platform.
\item A new programming language abstraction wouldn't fly without a troubleshooting
mechanism!
\item $\rightarrow$ analogously, adoption of SDN programming model depends on usability of its
debugging paradigm  \colin{</ why it's important>}
\item We present a principled approach: correctness iff correspondence \colin{</ how we
solve it>}
\end{itemize}

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In \S\ref{sec:overview},
we present an overview of the SDN stack and its failure modes.
In \S\ref{sec:approach} we present correspondence checking, our approach to
troubleshooting safety violations in SDN. In \S\ref{sec:evaluation} we present
two use-cases of correspondence checking, as well as a preliminary evaluation
of its runtime. Finally, in \S\ref{sec:related_work} we discuss related work,
and in \S\ref{sec:conclusion} we conclude.
