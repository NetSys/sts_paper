The predominant technique for troubleshooting bugs in software-defined networks,
log analysis, is tedious and error-prone. We argue that a more principled
approach should be built around identifying inconsistencies between lower-level
network configuration and higher-level policies dictated by control
applications. Towards this end we present
cross-layer correspondence checking, a mechanism to automatically detect and
isolate inconsistencies due to bugs in the SDN platform. In
eventually-consistent systems such as SDN however,
transient inconsistencies between policy and configuration are inevitable.
We therefore augment correspondence checking with \simulator to help troubleshooters
distinguish pernicious persistent from harmless ephemeral inconsistencies. We
show that these techniques combine to help troubleshooters ``see through the fog'' of
diagnostic information.
