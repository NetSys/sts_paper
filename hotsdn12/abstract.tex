The predominant technique for troubleshooting bugs in software-defined networks,
log analysis, is tedious and error-prone. We argue that a more principled
approach should be built around identifying inconsistencies between lower-level
network configuration and higher-level policies dictated by control
applications. Towards this end we present
cross-layer correspondence checking, a mechanism to automatically detect and
isolate policy-violations due to bugs in the SDN platform. In
distributed systems such as SDN however,
transient policy-violations are inevitable.
We therefore augment correspondence checking with \simulator{} to help troubleshooters
distinguish pernicious from harmless ephemeral policy-violations. We
show that these techniques combine to help troubleshooters ``see through the fog'' of
diagnostic information.
