The predominant technique for troubleshooting bugs in software-defined networks, log
analysis, is tedious and error-prone. We observe that
in eventually-consistent systems such as SDN, the process of troubleshooting
essentially boils down to identifying relevant events
amongst a clamor of inconsistencies and interacting components. We present two
mechanisms, cross-layer correspondence checking and simulated replay analysis, 
designed to make it easier for troubleshooters to ``see through the noise'' of
diagnostic information.
