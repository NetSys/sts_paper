The predominant technique for troubleshooting bugs in software-defined networks,
log analysis, is tedious and error-prone. We argue that a more principled
approach should be built around identifying inconsistencies between lower-level
network configuration and higher-level policies dictated by control
applications. Towards this end we present
cross-layer correspondence checking, a mechanism to automatically detect and
isolate policy-violations due to bugs in the SDN platform. We observe,
however, that in
distributed systems such as SDN 
transient policy-violations due to failures and delays are inevitable.
Our \simulator{} framework augments correspondence checking by helping troubleshooters
distinguish persitent from harmless ephemeral policy-violations.
We show that these mechanisms in combination can be used to quickly
identify the root cause of difficult errors, including isolation breaches,
faulty failover logic, and consistency problems between replicated
controllers.
