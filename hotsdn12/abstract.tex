The predominant technique for troubleshooting bugs in software-defined networks,
log analysis, is tedious and error-prone. We observe that
in eventually-consistent systems such as SDN,
transient inconsistencies between policy and network configuration are inevitable.
In addition to detecting and isolating inconsistencies,
troubleshooting mechanisms should therefore provide a mechanism to differentiate
pernicious persistent from harmless ephemeral inconsistencies. We present two
mechanisms, cross-layer correspondence checking and \simulator,
designed to make it easier for troubleshooters to ``see through the noise'' of
diagnostic information. We have implemented early prototypes of these
mechanisms, and are beginning to experiment with their use.
