Our paper seeks to improve the process of troubleshooting errors in the SDN
platform. We focus on datacenter-scale networks, 
where the SDN platform itself is distributed across multiple control servers,
provides virtualization potentially to multiple tenants. We present an
analysis of this environment's failure-modes, and present two mechanisms, cross-layer correspondence checking
and \simulator, 
designed to make it easier for troubleshooter to ``see through the noise'' of
diagnostic information.
