Our paper seeks to improve the process of troubleshooting errors in the SDN
platform. We focus on large, production networks, 
where controllers are distributed across multiple servers
and the platform provides a virtualization abstraction to one or more tenants.
We present two mechanisms, cross-layer correspondence checking
and \simulator{}, designed to help troubleshooters automatically identify
and isolate inconsistencies between high-level policy and low-level configuration 
caused by bugs in the platform. Our intent throughout this work is to convince
the troubleshooting community to think outside of the NOX!
