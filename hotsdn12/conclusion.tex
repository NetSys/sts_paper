Our paper seeks to improve the process of troubleshooting errors in the SDN
platform. We present two mechanisms, cross-layer correspondence checking
and simulated replay analysis, 
designed to make it easier for troubleshooter to ``see through the noise'' of
diagnostic information. These tools are based on the observation that 
troubleshooting eventually-consistent systems such as SDN essentially
involves differentiating common, ephemeral inconsistencies form persistent
errors. \colin{Lacking obligatory ``HotNetsesque audacious claim''}
