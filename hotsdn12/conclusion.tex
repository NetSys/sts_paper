\begin{itemize}
\item We observed that troubleshooting eventually consistent systems boils down to
``seeing through the noise'' of inconsistencies
\item We present two techniques to help see through noise
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Correspondence checking as general notion of correctness yields isolation to a
    system component
    \item Record/Replay + Simulator as ``time-machine'' yields isolation of important vs.
    noisy events. Focus on corner-cases.
    \end{itemize}
\item Our use-case supports our argument
\end{itemize}
