\begin{itemize}
\item Description of Platform: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item Reactive vs. Proactive flow entry installation
   \item Distributed controllers
   \item Physical, logical, and virtual layers
\end{itemize}
\item Taxonomy of failure modes introduced by these abstractions (Google Doc),
and why they're hard to debug.
\item Fence-post: we focus on platform bugs. This is complementary to work on
application debugging (NICE) and dataplane debugging (Anteater, HSA).
\end{itemize}
