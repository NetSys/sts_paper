\begin{itemize}
\item What does it mean for the platform to be correct? Well, the platform
should implement the application's policies!
\item More formally: the virtual graph should correspond to the physical
graph.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Assume application is correct.
    \item SDN stack is just graphs, all the way up.
    \item Not a one-to-one mapping for the network, but the hosts are respresented all the way
    up.
    \item Take snapshot of those graphs.
    \item Compute Omega for all layers.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Convert flow tables into abstract transformation functions.
        \item Feed symbolic packet to each access link to generate
        propogation graph.
        \item Leaves of the propogation graph represent transitive closure of
        transformation functions.
        \item Don't care about intermediate propogation nodes, only final
        location.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Comparing Omegas yields inconsistencies, including which layers
    they appear in.
    \end{itemize}
\item This tells you the general cause of the of the error (not detailed
debugging info)
\item If you're just looking for who to blame, all you need is correspondence
checking!
\item Correspondence checking only tells you behavior at one point in time.
Also, there will almost always be inconsitencies, due to delays, failures,
\etc.
\item \colin{new subsection here?} If you're looking for something more than just ``where is the problem'', need a record and replay mechanism to capture the time axis.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Since proactive, just need snapshots of production routing tables,
    link state events, and controller state events.
    \item Feed into simulated model of production network. 
    \item simulator enables deterministic ``time-travel''.
    \item determinstic ``time-travel'' enables a debugging loop. We tell you
    the component, you put in more printfs, rinse and repeat until bug is found.
    \item Insight: punt to human intuition. Differentiate between harmful and
    harmless inconsitencies by playing forward in time, exluding extraneous
    external events.
    \item \colin{Mention that model checking could help here?}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\colin{Concern: redundant with next section! Shouldn't go into too much detail
here}
