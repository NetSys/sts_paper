\begin{itemize}
\item What does it mean for the platform to be correct? Well, the platform
should implement the application's policies!
\item More formally: the virtual graph should correspond to the physical
graph.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Assume application is correct.
    \item SDN stack is just graphs, all the way up.
    \item Not a one-to-one mapping for the network, but the hosts are respresented all the way
    up.
    \item Take snapshot of those graphs.
    \item Compute Omega for all layers.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Convert flow tables into abstract transformation functions.
        \item Feed symbolic packet to each access link to generate
        propogation graph.
        \item Leaves of the propogation graph represent transitive closure of
        transformation functions.
        \item Don't care about intermediate propogation nodes, only final
        location.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Comparing Omegas yields inconsistencies, including which layers
    they appear in.
    \end{itemize}
\item This tells you the general cause of the of the error (not detailed
debugging info)
\item If you're just looking for who to blame, all you need is correspondence
checking!
\item For SDN developers though, need a bit more. Correspondence checking only tells you behavior at one point in time.
Also, there will almost always be inconsitencies, due to delays, failures,
\etc.
\item \colin{new subsection here?} need a record / replay / simulate mechanism to capture the time axis.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Since proactive, just need snapshots of production routing tables,
    link state events, and controller state events.
    \item Feed ``before-bug'' or ``after-bug'' state into simulated model of production network. 
    \item simulator enables deterministic ``time-travel'' and nice debugging
    loop.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item We tell you the component where the problem manifests
        \item you put in more printfs
        \item If you want, induce failures, delays, drops, etc.
        \item you play forward in time, to help you find which events matter
        \item rinse and repeat until bug is found.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \colin{Mention that model checking could help here?}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
