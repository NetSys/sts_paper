\begin{itemize}
\item Use case 1: network operator doesn't know anything about SDN.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Host A can't talk to host B.
    \item Runs correspondence checking, and there aren't loops in his policy
    \item Call up Nicira! WTF man, this is your fault.
    \end{itemize}
\item Use case 2: datacenter operator receives customer complaint.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Customer complains about high packet loss.
    \item Operator feeds in current production snapshot to simulator, verifies that loops
    exist.
    \item Operator backs up to last major code revision, and verifies no
    loops.
    \item Operator steps through execution until loops are found.
    \item At each time step, runs correspondence.
    \item Isolates the events that matter.
    \item Plays them forward to differentiate harmless from harmful.
    \item Isolates to the virtualization layer.
    \item Puts in log statements, re-runs through debugger
    \item eventually finds one line of code that caused the problem.
    \end{itemize}
\item \colin{New subsection} Back-of-envelope calculation of HSA runtime,
space overhead of logging routing tables.
\item Discussion of realistic mapping between simulated environment and
production environment?
