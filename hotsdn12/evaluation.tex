\begin{itemize}
\item Use case 1: network operator doesn't know anything about SDN.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Rackspace operator doesnâ€™t know much about SDN stack! Just pays for
    her GUI
    \item isolation violation between tenant A and tenant B!
    \item Runs correspondence checking, and there are indeed inconsistencies!
    \item Call up Nicira!
    \end{itemize}
\item Use case 2: datacenter operator receives complaint from that customer!
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Operator feeds in current production snapshot to simulator, verifies
    isolation violation.
    \item Operator backs up to last major code revision, and verifies 
    isolation.
    \item Operator steps through execution until first point in time when
    isolation is broken again
    \item Isolates to virualization layer
    \item Isolates the events that matter.
    \item Plays them forward to differentiate ephemeral from persistent.
    \item Puts in log statements, re-runs through debugger
    \item eventually finds one line of code that caused the problem.
    \item pushes change to production
    \end{itemize}
\item Potential use case 3: library of corner cases as integration test /
burn-in test:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Simulator gives complete control over network
    \item Unlike code tests, which exercise code branches, simulator exercises
    the network!
    \item Gather library of corner-cases that have caused other controllers to
    topple
    \end{itemize}
\item \colin{New subsection} Graph of simulation scalability (\# of switches
vs. time to push packet through network)
\item Back-of-envelope calculation of HSA runtime, space overhead of logging routing tables.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Peynam's conjecture is that HSA runtime scales quadratically with \#
    of wilcard expression.  See Section 6.3 of
    \url{http://stanford.edu/~kazemian/hsa.pdf}
    \item They ran loop detection on Stanford backbone (medium network) in ~10
    minutes.
    \end{itemize}
\item How do you validate the simulator? Is it sufficiently complex to
capture real-world bugs? Conversely, if I catch a failure mode in the
simulator, will my fix work in the production network?
\end{itemize}
