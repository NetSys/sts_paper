Software bugs are inevitable in distributed systems, and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time-consuming task.
In this paper we present a technique for automatically identifying
a minimal sequence of inputs responsible for triggering a given bug.
Our technique works by
iteratively pruning inputs from the history of the execution, and
coping with divergent histories by reasoning about the functional equivalence
of events.

We apply our technique to three software-defined networking control
platforms---Floodlight, POX, and NOX---and
illustrate how our technique found minimal causal sequences for
the bugs we encountered.
