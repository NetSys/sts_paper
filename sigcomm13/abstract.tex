Software bugs abound in distributed systems, and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time-consuming task.
In this paper we present a technique for automatically identifying
a minimal sequence of inputs responsible for triggering a given bug.
Our technique works by
iteratively pruning inputs from the history of the system execution and
comparing divergent histories
by applying domain knowledge about the semantic equivalence of events.

We apply our technique to three software-defined networking control
platforms---Floodlight, POX, and NOX---and
are able to isolate minimal causal sequences of inputs for
\colin{N} bugs: faulty failover logic between replicated controllers, and incorrect
synchronization with the physical network.
