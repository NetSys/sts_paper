Software bugs abound in distributed systems, and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time-consuming task.
In this paper we present a technique for automatically identifying
a minimal sequence of fault-inducing inputs from logs. Our technique works by
iteratively altering the history contained in the logs, and comparing divergent histories
by applying domain knowledge about semantic equivalence of events.

We apply our technique to several software-defined networking control
platforms---Floodlight, POX, and NOX---and
are able to isolate minimal causal sequences of inputs for
\colin{N} bugs: faulty failover logic between replicated controllers, and incorrect
synchronization with the physical network.
