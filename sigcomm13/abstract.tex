Software bugs abound in distributed systems, and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time consuming task.
In this paper we present a technique for automatically identifying
a minimal set of fault-inducing inputs from logs. Our technique works by
iteratively altering the history of the logs, and comparing divergent histories
by applying domain knowledge about semantic equivalence of events.

We apply our technique to several software-defined networking control
platforms---Floodlight, POX, and NOX---and
are able to isolate the minimal sequence of inputs that triggered
\colin{N} bugs: faulty failover logic between replicated controllers, and incorrect
synchronization with the physical network.
