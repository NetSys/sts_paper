Software bugs are inevitable in software-defined networking (SDN) control planes,
and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time-consuming task.
In this paper we discuss how one might improve SDN
network troubleshooting by presenting a technique for automatically identifying
a minimal sequence of inputs responsible for triggering a given bug in the
control software.
Our technique works by
iteratively pruning inputs from the history of the execution, and
coping with divergent histories by reasoning about the functional equivalence
of events.

We apply our technique to three open source SDN control
platforms---Floodlight, POX, and NOX---and
illustrate how our technique found minimal causal sequences for
the bugs we encountered.
