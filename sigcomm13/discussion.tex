\Simulator~is certainly not without limitations. We discuss several of them
here.

\noindent{\bf Is \simulator~specific to SDN?}
\colin{revamp with formalism}
Luckily, SDN has several properties that make it particularly amenable to an
automated troubleshooting approach such as ours. Most importantly, SDN control software
quickly converges to quiescence--that is, SDN controllers become idle when no policy or
topology changes occur for a period of time. In contrast to long-running iterative computations,
this means that individual inputs to the system have a relatively isolated effect on the outcome
of the computation; if we prune one input from the log and replay the execution, it is unlikely
that the new outcome will be radically different from the original. If this were not the case, our
technique would not be able to significantly decrease the size of execution traces, as will will become clear in
\S\ref{subsec:algorithm}.

SDN's architecture also facilitates the implementation of our troubleshooting
tool. The syntax and semantics of interfaces between components of the system (\eg~OpenFlow
between controllers and switches~\cite{openflow}, or
OpenStack Quantum's API between
the control application and the network hypervisor~\cite{quantum}), are
well-defined--a property that is crucial for
enabling us to compare altered histories (described in \S\ref{subsec:replay}).
Moreover, controllers are relatively small in number compared to the size of
overall network, which makes it much easier to superimpose
on messages (described in detail in~\S\ref{subsec:replay}).

\noindent{\bf Are all simulated failures really indistinguishable
from actual failures?}
Maybe not, but since the simulator
is built in software, the fidelity of our simulated failures
can be made arbitrarily sophisticated.\footnote{Subject to scalability
limitations of fine-grained simulations}

\noindent{\bf Will this approach work on all control platforms?}
So long as the controller under test supports OpenFlow 1.0, \simulator{}
works out of the box. Some log statements may need to be added if there is
insufficient synchronization for reproducing errors across replayed
executions.

\noindent{\bf Will control platforms ever become stable enough that
          \simulator{} is unnecessary?}
We certainly hope so! The field is decades from that point though.

\noindent{\bf Is this technique specific to SDN?}
We believe that our technique is applicable to most control plane systems,
for example NAS controllers or MapReduce job trackers. The components of our
tool that are specific to SDN are the simulator and the masks for control
messages.

\noindent{\bf How big is the log? How long does this take to run?}
Assuming that it takes constant time to inject an external input, the
runtime of the algorithm is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of external inputs to
prune. If the log is too long to rerun from the beginning for
every iteration, the operator can take causally-consistent
snapshots~\cite{Chandy:1985:DSD:214451.214456} of the
live system and bootstrap the simulator from the nearest quiescent snapshot.
The length of the execution can also be `compressed' by manipulating timers in the
controllers while still maintaining happens-before dependencies. Lastly, note
that although the worst-case runtime of \simulator{} must be at least $O(n)$
(since any of the inputs may be part of the MCS), the average-case runtime of
the algorithm may be optimized by running multi-key binary search rather than
linear search.

\noindent{\bf Isn't a global log difficult to obtain?} Some failure events may appear
multiple times in the log (\eg{} replica servers detecting that a master went down),
yet we only want to replay the original event.
If it is not possible to distinguish the original
failure event from the resulting events (\eg{} in the case of a disk failure
where the original crash message is not recoverable), developers may need to
manually decipher the original event.
If the simulator is unable to reproduce the correctness violation,
the simulator may be able to `fuzz' different event
orderings in an attempt to retrigger it.

\noindent{\bf What if there are causal dependencies between inputs events?}
Developers need to know how the
distributed system {\it reacts} to external inputs. Understanding why external
inputs occurred is an orthogonal issue.
Consider a mud slide that causes (i) an network uplink to fail, which subsequently
causes (ii) a switch to overheat and crash. Our
system views (i) and (ii) as causally independent, and that's fine, since
the developer's goal is not to reason about the cause of the switch
overheating or the cause of the link failure, only how the distributed system reacted to
those events.


\colin{Discuss applicability to distributed systems besides SDN}

%\noindent{\bf How is this specific to SDN?}
%
%Yes!

\eat{
Second, we hope to gather error logs from real production deployments which
will help us populate this repository; this may require providing novel kinds
of anonymization, so that large datacenter operators would be willing to share
their problems (since they want their SDN code to work) without revealing the
details of their network.  This may require a infrastructural counterpart to
minimally-causal events; the smallest number of infrastructure components that
can reproduce the same bug.
}

\eat{
\colin{TODO: add note about not being able to tell difference between
endogenous and exogenous events, which might hide the true cause of a bug.
This is OK though, since we assume that the platform should always have a
correct option, but it doesn't take it. That is, the root cause of the crash
is not what we're interested in (software vs. hardware), it's how the platform
reacts to that crash that matters (should be robust, no matter what the
cause of the crash)}

\andi{Don't quite know what you mean by endogenous vs. exogenous}

\colin{Note that we also assume an out-of-band management network between
switches and controllers, and that the management network always provides 
connectivity. We could add the management network into our model if we want, I
suppose.}
}

\eat{ % The production environment logs this anyway? Add this point in
      % if we have space.
\noindent{\bf Aren't the proposed production logs going to be huge?}

In contrast to general record-and-replay
mechanisms, the amount of recorded state needed for
high-fidelity replay is tractable\andi{Check with our newly, well defined strong assumptions: 
we need full internal/external events. Is this tractable}. With proactive flow installation,
updates are pushed to routing tables over a relatively long time scale; periodic
FIB snapshots along with a log of link state events, control server
downtime, host mobility information, and policy-changes suffice for our purposes.
Assuming a maximum of 256K routing or ACL entries per switch~\cite{cisco7000}, and 
36 bytes per entry, each FIB will contain a maximum of 9216
kilobytes, uncompressed. A fat tree network of 27,648 hosts
includes 2,880
switches~\cite{Al-Fares:2008:SCD:1402958.1402967}.
Therefore a snapshot of the FIBs of the entire network would naively take up roughly
26 GB. Note however, that the data is likely to be compressible quite well, due to do its
structural and temporal properties. Assuming 8.5 error events per minute per
datacenter~\cite{Greenberg:2009:VSF:1592568.1592576}, 1,000,000
VM placement changes per day per datacenter~\cite{Soundararajan:2010:CBS:1899928.1899941},
and a small rate of human-specified policy changes, the log of the external inputs
should grow at a rate of \textasciitilde 750 entries per minute.
}

%To account for host mobility, assume that each server hosts 10 VMs,
%and 1\% of VMs are created, suspended, or migrated every minute. Then 10,000 host mobility events must be
%logged per minute, also a reasonable storage cost.

\eat{
\colin{Notes from Rean Griffith:
\begin{itemize}
\item total vms in a typical datacenter: 1000
\item migration frequency (migrations/minute): 20 per hour
\item VM spin ups/downs: 150 power ons per hour (see our OSR 2010 paper for
power off estimates)
\item Do we log VM migrations and how does that log grow (I wasn't able to
get any estimates on log-growth data)

TODO: Replace this analysis.
It stinks. PORTLAND is not the right way to evaluate this due to the lacking number of rules.

\noindent{\bf Correspondence Checking Runtime.} 
Computing the propagation
graph for correspondence checking is equivalent to enumerating
all possible paths in the network, which scales with the diameter
of the network and the number of routing entries per switch.
The propagation graph for each host can be
computed in parallel however, so the computation is bottlenecked by the serial runtime
of computing a single host's propagation graph.

We show the serial runtime of correspondence checking in
Figure~\ref{fig:hsa_runtime}. For this analysis we generated fat tree topologies
between 2 and 48 pods wide, with pre-installed PORTLAND~\cite{NiranjanMysore:2009:PSF:1592568.1592575}
routing tables in each switch. Each data point is the minimum of three
runs on a single Intel Xeon 2.80GHz core. Note that the number of PORTLAND routing entries per switch scales with the number
of pods in the fat-tree. We excluded the time to convert
flow tables to HSA transfer functions, since transfer functions can be maintained
offline.

As the figure depicts, even for large networks
(27,648 hosts) the serial runtime of correspondence checking is reasonable for
interactive use. The number of serial tasks to be executed
is the number of hosts in the network squared, disregarding ECMP load balancing.

    $x^3/4$ hosts and $5x^2/4$ switches (\eg{} 48 pods means 27,468 hosts
    attached to 2,880 switches)}
\end{figure}
}

\eat{ This evaluation stinks. Be gone!

\noindent{\bf Simulator Scalability.} As our approach depends on the frequently
repeating simulations, we now evaluate the setup time incurred by the simulator
system when handling large network topologies. For this experiment, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:scalability}, we generate fat tree topologies between 2 and 48
pods wide, where all switches in the network connected to a single controller.
The controller sends each switch an OpenFlow $FLOW\_MOD$ and subsequent
$BARRIER\_REQUEST$ message, and waits for the corresponding $BARRIER\_REPLY$. We
then measure the time to between the first $FLOW\_MOD$ sent and the last
$BARRIER\_REPLY$ received. As expected, the runtime was roughly linear with the
number of switches in the network. The figure also shows that the processing
time for large networks (5 seconds per simulator round) was well within the
bounds for interactive use.

\begin{figure}[t]
    %\hspace{-10pt}
    \includegraphics[width=3.25in]{../graphs/scalability_graph/scale.pdf}
    \caption[]{\label{fig:scalability} Time to send and process messages
    between controller and simulated switches. Each datapoint consists of
    $x^3/4$ hosts and $5x^2/4$ switches (\eg{} 48 pods means 27,468 hosts
    attached to 2,880 switches)}
\end{figure}

We also tested the extreme limits of the simulator's scalability, pushing up
the number of switches until something broke. We encountered what appears to be
a limitation of the Linux TCP/IP stack: TCP connection attempts began failing
beyond 26,680 sockets. Note that 26,680 switches is an order-of-magnitude larger than
the today's biggest networks.
