In this document we attempt to formalize some of the questions left open by
STS~\cite{sts}, a system for finding minimal causal sequences of inputs from
buggy executions of software-defined networks.

In terms of problem statements, the closest work to ours is program flow-based
log reduction~\cite{zhang2006dynamic,tallam2007enabling,Lee:2011:TGR:1993498.1993528,huang2012lean},
which seeks to remove irrelevant events from deterministic replay logs
(consisting of syscall return values, asynchronous signals, and a thread
schedule) by analyzing the
software to infer which events trigger code paths that do not effect whether
the bug occurs. The crucial difference in our problem statement is that
we do not have access to the internal behavior of control software, and
instead can only observe which messages the software sends in response to input events.

We start in \S\ref{sec:problem_statement} by formulating our own problem
statement in detail.
