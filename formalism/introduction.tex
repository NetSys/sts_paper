In this document we attempt to formalize some of the questions left open by
STS~\cite{sts}, a system for finding minimal causal sequences of inputs from
buggy executions of software-defined networks.

In terms of problem statements, the closest work to ours is log reduction
based on program flow analysis~\cite{zhang2006dynamic,tallam2007enabling,Lee:2011:TGR:1993498.1993528},
which seeks to remove irrelevant events from deterministic replay logs
(consisting of syscall return values, asynchronous signals, and a thread
schedule) by analyzing the
software to infer which events trigger code paths that do not effect whether
the bug occurs. The crucial difference in our problem statement is that
we treat the control software as a blackbox, and
can only observe which messages the software sends in response to input events.

We start in \S\ref{sec:problem_statement} by formulating our own problem
statement in detail.
