Internal events may differ syntactically (\eg~sequence numbers
of control packets may all differ) when replaying a subsequence of the original log.
Nonetheless, we observe that often these altered internal events are {\em functionally
equivalent}, in the sense that they
have the same effect on the state of the system with respect to triggering the
invariant violation (despite syntactic differences).

Formally, $\dots$.
