Real-world question: does MCS help developers find bugs?

\begin{outline}
\1 Case study 1: POX in-flight blackhole [anectodes from Murphy]
\1 Case study 2: NOX loop [TBD: anectodes from Amin]
\1 Case study 3: Floodlight loops [TBD: anectodes from Andi]
\end{outline}

Should mention that distributed controllers have only recently come out in the
public domain--at the time we performed these case studies, there were very
few open souece SDN applications more complex than routing.
