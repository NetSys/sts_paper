Real-world question: does MCS help developers find bugs?

\begin{outline}
\1 Case study 1: POX in-flight blackhole [anecdotes from Murphy]
\1 Case study 2: NOX loop [TBD: anecdotes from Amin]
\1 Case study 3: Floodlight loops [TBD: anecdotes from Andi]
\end{outline}

\colin{Should mention that distributed controllers have only recently come out in the
public domain--at the time we performed these case studies, there were very
few open source SDN applications more complex than routing.}

\colin{Should mention how many other bugs we found.}
