Dumb approach: explore all timings T for each subset of $E_L$.

Slightly smarter approach:
\begin{outline}
  \1 apply delta debugging to efficiently search subsets of $E_L$
  \1 But $T$ is still really important to get right. We tried a replay algorithm that just maintained relative spacing between inputs, but it didn't work.
  \1 Problem is that internal events matter. We need to maintain causal relationships.
  \1 But we're  changing history, i.e. the original causal relation is changing
  \1 so we define equivalence to reason about changes to history
  \1 we also need to time out on missing internal events.
  \1 and let unexpected events through
  \1 this leaves exactly one set of timings $T$ to look at, that in our experience reliably reproduces the bugs while still minimizing.
\end{outline}

In the next section we outline our solution to these difficulties.
