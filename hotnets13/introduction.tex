In the next section we formally define the problem of isolating fault-inducing
inputs to distributed systems. We then outline our approach in
\S\ref{sec:approach}, and the
system we built to realize our approach in \S\ref{sec:systems_challenges}.
We end by describing preliminary case studies that illustrate how minimized
input traces help sofware developers fix bugs.
