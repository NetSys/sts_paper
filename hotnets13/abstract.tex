Software bugs are inevitable in software-defined networking (SDN) control planes,
and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time-consuming task.
In this paper we discuss how one might improve
control software troubleshooting by presenting a technique
for automatically identifying
a minimal sequence of inputs responsible for triggering a given bug.
We present three preliminary case studies of real bugs we have found in open source SDN control
platforms---Floodlight, POX, and NOX---and
illustrate how the minimal sequences our technique found were useful for
understanding the root cause of the bugs.
