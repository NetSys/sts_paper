Software bugs are inevitable in software-defined networking (SDN) control planes,
and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time-consuming task.
In this paper we discuss how one might improve
control software troubleshooting by presenting a technique
for automatically identifying
a minimal sequence of inputs responsible for triggering a given bug.
Our approach works by
iteratively pruning inputs from the history of the execution, and
coping with divergent histories by reasoning about the functional equivalence
of events.

We present three preliminary case studies of real bugs we have found in open source SDN control
platforms---Floodlight, POX, and NOX---and
illustrate how the minimal sequences our technique found were useful for
understanding the root cause of the bugs.
