There are some practical challenges involved in implementing this approach in
practice, including:

Need a way to fuzz traces and replay them: network simulator.

Need visibility into as many internal events as possible: optional
interposition on logging

Need to cope with non-determinism in the operating system: multiplexed sockets
and overriding gettimeofday()

Can't squash all the non-determinism: replaying multiple times yields
Bernoulli probability that bug wonâ€™t be triggered
