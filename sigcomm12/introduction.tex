\item Status quo is to painstakingly look at logs. 
\item SDN provides layers of abstraction.
\item Our focus is on debugging the abstractions provided by the platform.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Assume the application is correct
  \item Check correspondence between app + other layers
  \item Checking correspondence once isn't enough $\Rightarrow$ need (sophisticated) test harness
\end{itemize}

\item Failures and updates are what make consistency hard! Normal running conditions are pretty tame.

\end{itemize}
