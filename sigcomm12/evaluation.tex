\begin{itemize}

\item Caveat: not evaluating on a commercial code base, (since NOX doesn't have layering, and we don't have access to Onix)

\item Is it general enough? $\Rightarrow$ walk through failure cases described in Section 2, and show how debugger helps with them

\item Does it find bugs? $\Rightarrow$ run on third party application (Murphy's code?)

\item Does it have reasonable overhead? $\Rightarrow$ Graph of performance for interactive test harness use

\end{itemize}
