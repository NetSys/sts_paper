We have applied \simulator~to three open source SDN control platforms:
POX~\cite{pox}, NOX~\cite{nox}, and Floodlight~\cite{bigswitch}. Over a span
of roughly five days of
investigation we found a total of five bugs. \Simulator~reduced the
size of the input trace to 36\% of its original size in
the worst case and 2\% of its original size in the best case.

We briefly describe one bug in POX's routing module to illustrate the value of minimal causal sets.
We noticed that our tool reported a persistent blackhole while POX was bootstrapping its
discovery of link and host locations. There were 68 inputs in the initial trace, and \simulator~returned a 25 input
MCS. With the MCS in hand we took out paper and pencil to decipher what had
transpired.

We found that the crucial triggering events were two
{\em in-flight} packets (set in motion by prior traffic injection events)
concurrent with POX discovering a switch-switch link:
POX incorrectly learned a host location as a result of the first in-flight
packet, and
neglected to return out of a nested conditional as result the second in-flight
packet. We have sent the replayable trace generated by \simulator~to the lead
developer of POX, and await his response.

These fine-grained race conditions would have been very difficult to reproduce
in Mininet~\cite{handigol2012reproducible} or real hardware. With our
simulator's ability to arbitrarily delay messages, the bug was easily uncovered. And with
an MCS in hand, it was straightforward to identify the root cause from an
otherwise complicated trace.
